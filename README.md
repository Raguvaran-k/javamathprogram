Math class contains methods for performing basic numeric operations such as the elementary exponential,logarithm,square root,and trigonometric functions.This program is used for the simple mathematical Calculations.It contains the set of built-in operators to perform the simple operations.Math class which contains methods for performing the advanced math calculations.The + operator performs an addition operation. The - operator performs an subtraction operation.The * operator is used to perform an Multiplication operation.The / operator is used to perform the division operation.The operator precedence determines the order in which the operator in an expressions are evaluated. In Floating point types are capable of containing fractions in the numbers.The Math.abs() function returns the absolute value of the parameter passed to it.The Math.ceil() function rounds a floating point value up to the nearest integer value.The Math.floor() function rounds a floating point value down to the nearest integer value.The Math.floorDiv() method divides one integer by another, and rounds the result down to the nearest integer value.The Math.min() method returns the smallest of two values.The Math.min() method will return the value which is small.The Math.max() method will return the value which is bigger among the two values.The Math.round() method is used to round off the given value.The Math.random() method will give the value randomly.The Math.exp() function returns the power of the value provided as parameters
I have declared the integer value,but i have give me String and byte value .so the error is input mismachexception error.
